# Shopping cart application in React

This is an exercise as part of Module 14 of MIT xPro Full Stack Bootcamp

The goal is to use React to create a shopping cart application where you can transfer items from a product list to the shopping cart. The files uploaded so far are *super rough draft* with a shit ton of notes to help me understand these codes.
